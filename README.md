# PacMen

This project recreates the PacMan video game in which a circular character moves around the screen gobbling up particles. With this code, the PacMan figure will bounce around the screen, changing direction when it hits an edge.  Another cool thing about this code it can be run with as many PacMen as you like!

## How to Run

To run the PacMen exercise, first click "Add PacMan".  Doing this will generate a PacMan on the screen; feel free to add as many PacMen as you like by continuing to click on the "Add PacMan" button.  After you have added at least one PacMan, to start the game and let the PacMan roam around the page, click the button "Start Game".

## Future Improvements

There are some next steps to make this exercise more interesting.  In the PacMan video game, there are power-ups that make the PacMan stronger and a different color for a short amount of time.  One thing to add in the future could be a "Power-Up" button along side the other buttons which changes the color of the PacMen that are on the screen.
